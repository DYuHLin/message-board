# mini-message-board
This was a cool project to work on and a good introduction into making my own project with express, node, mongoDB and ejs. I did have trouble at first with the routing and then showing the results from the database. I also had a bit of a problem using ejs but I think that I have a somewhat good idea of how to use it better now. I learnt a lot doing this project.
